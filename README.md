# Shiny_DataScience

The explosion of the data as the human race stepped into the infromation age has been of the biggest thing happened in the past few decades. The consequences of this can be seen everywhere. No matter where we are, its all about the data. Machine Learning and Data Vizulations became the 'cool' thing to have added to the resume. It was really no surprise that the DataScientist role was considered the sexiest job of the 21st century. The number of roles in the field have reached all time highs. Yet, there is still a dire need for good data scientists in the community. At this moment, one has to ask 'How come so much data and the massive interest data science projects among the community are not able to solve the need for data scientists?' We believe the answer is simple. Most of the data science roles in the industry require a strong background in both statistics and a strong background in programming languages such as Python, R, Java etc. This means, most of these reuqire you to have an academic background in CS,ECE and other similar fields. This means a major chunk of people have been left out! What about the statisticians who do not have a background in coding? What about those pursuing a degree in Business Intelligence who could identify some key patterns which could go unnoticed from the usual CS/ECE developers? 
Shiny DataScience is a web applications which is built with just solving this goal in mind. We believe bridging the gap between the non-coder and datascience.

 The project has quite unique and helpful features that we believe could help a lot of people join the Data Science realm.
 The user can upload data files on the web app and receive a quick summary of the data.
 There are also some tools which can be used to visualize the data which leverage the R Porgramming Language and it's packages to generate bar,scatter,geo-spatial plots and much more without writing a single Line of Code!
Now, dont get us wrong. We do not want to discourage people from learning Programming. Instead we want EXACTLY the OPPOSITE. We just chose a less traditional approach to achieving this goal. This is the reason, for every tool on the web app, we have a code-block which displays the code used to generate the plot/run an algorithm. This is Exactly the opposite way a Notebook works. Usually, the user writes the code and then observes its output. Here, we let the user generate the output using a GUI and then show him the back end processing. We aim at creating a GUI which provides atleast most(if not all) the options avaialable from the packages so the user can have a truly unique and complete learning experience. 

 ## [PROJECT FEATURES] 
Developing a customer-centric and customer driven project was the main goal of the team for Shiny Data Science. This has led us develop some features which we believe will not only help the groth of the user, but also the entire community and ecosystem of the application. Features include :
1. Simple and intuituve UI for the beginner data scientist created with JavaScript and Shiny.
2. A quick view of the data at the finger tips of the user with a set of popular data visualizations and machine learning tools.
3. Uses an innovative way to teach users by first letting them generate and then make them understand the code
4. Uses R for data processing which is one of the most popular languages among the data science community. 
5. Its open-source, duh!


 *We are aware we have a long way to go to create a complete project. But it is the need of the hour that an open-soruce tool aimed for the less code-savvy people interested in learning data science were given a chance to build learn and develop and that is what we strive to achieve with this project. Shiny DataScience is here to help the current open-source community and more importantly, to grow it to all the corners of the world.
