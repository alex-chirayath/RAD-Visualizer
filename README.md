# Shiny_DataScience

The explosion of the data as the human race stepped into the infromation age has been of the biggest thing happened in the past few decades. The consequences of this can be seen everywhere. No matter where we are, its all about the data. Machine Learning and Data Vizulations became the 'cool' thing to have added to the resume. It was really no surprise that the DataScientist role was considered the sexiest job of the 21st century. The number of roles in the field have reached all time highs. Yet, there is still a dire need for good data scientists in the community. At this moment, one has to ask 'How come so much data and the massive interest data science projects among the community are not able to solve the need for data scientists?' We believe the answer is simple. Most of the data science roles in the industry require a strong background in both statistics and a strong background in programming languages such as Python, R, Java etc. This means, most of these reuqire you to have an academic background in CS,ECE and other similar fields. This means a major chunk of people have been left out! What about the statisticians who do not have a background in coding? What about those pursuing a degree in Business Intelligence who could identify some key patterns which could go unnoticed from the usual CS/ECE developers?
